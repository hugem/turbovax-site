        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>How do sign up for a vaccine in NYC?</dt>
          <dd>Please refer to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nyc-vaccine-shot.html" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em></a> and  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nyc-vaccine-shot.html" target="_blank">Gothamist</a> guides for general questions about the process.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>What can TurboVax do? What can't it do?</dt>
          <dd>Simply put: TurboVax queries vaccine scheduling websites to find available appointment slots. It <u>cannot</u> book appointments on your behalf.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>Why did you build TurboVax?</dt>
          <dd>The existing vaccine scheduling ecosystem is too complicated, biased towards the computer-literate. We hope this tool will make for a more fair (and less stressful) playing field for all.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>Why couldn't I find the appointment that you tweeted?</dt>
          <dd>Availability is limited and demand is high. At the very moment, there are probably hundreds (if not thousands) of New Yorkers looking for appointments on the very same websites as you are. In our experience, any available appointments are almost always reserved within <em>one minute</em>.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>How can I set myself up for success?</dt>
          <dd>
              <p>Every second matters. Login and pre-fill all required forms, so that you are ready to hit the "find availability" step at a moment's notice.</p>
              <p><u>For NYC H+H website</u>: Fill out your data. To check availability, select <code>I, [First Name] [Last Name]</code> checkbox. If no availability, unselect and reselect the checkbox to quickly recheck availability.</p>
              <p><u>For NYC Vaccine Hub website</u>: Fill out your data until you are at Step 6. To check availability, select the relevant administration site and date. If no availability, click <code>Previous</code> to recheck availability at another site.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>How reliable is TurboVax?</dt>
          <dd>Unclear! This is currently just some code running on some guy's laptopâ€”anything as much as a wifi outage could knock it out. We also do not have any special access to proprietary data; our work could be undone anytime if authorities want to shut this down.</dd>
